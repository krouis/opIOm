Todo:

2010-02-17

    * for the PACKAGE :
      * write a README file for distribution.
      * write the documentation ./doc.
      * check compatibility with other NIX flavours
    * for the program :
      * add measure random synchronous writing function.
      * add output files for the unitary requests at least.
      * read parameters from a file (gengetopt does that just need to add it to opiom.c)
