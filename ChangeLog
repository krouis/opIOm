* src/functions.c (measure_random_synchronous_write)
                  (measure_write_through): added intialization of
                  `write_buffer` with random data to be written.

* src/functions.c (measure_random_direct_read): changed the `testfile-name`
                  opening and `read_buffer` allocation to a conditional
		  state to ensure more compatibility.
		  Deleted 2010-02-18 compatibility modifications to correct
		  the bug they create (F_NOCACHE is a fcntl argument).

* src/functions.c (measure_random_synchronous_write): New function.
                  Added tests for compatibility with DARWIN (Mac OS)
		  if DARWIN, O_DIRECT becomes F_NOCACHE
* src/opiom.c (main): added conditional execution of 
                      measure_random_synchronous_write if `a.random_flag_given`
	              and `a.write_flag_given`.
* configure.in: incremented release version to 0.5
                included /lib to the autoconfig
* added gnulib  getopt for gengetopt (in order to be more portable)
